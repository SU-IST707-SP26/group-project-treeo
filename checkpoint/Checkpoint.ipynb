    "Overview:\n",
    "Our dataset covers all crime incidents reported to the LAPD going back to 2020. The core problem is straightforward: the LAPD has a finite number of patrol units and needs to figure out where to put them. That's a harder question than it sounds, and historical hotspot maps alone aren't enough to answer it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most crime prediction models look at static relationships — things like linking demographic data to crime rates — but that approach tends to reinforce over-policing in areas that already get heavy surveillance. We're trying to do something different. Instead of just predicting where crime will happen, we're framing this as a deployment question: where should the LAPD actually field its forces? That shift matters because it forces us to deal with a problem that pure prediction models usually ignore, reported crime isn't the same as actual crime. If an area has less police presence, fewer crimes get reported there, so a model trained only on reported data will keep sending resources to the same places and neglecting everywhere else.\n",
    "\n",
    "To account for this, we're building in an adjustment that estimates how police presence affects the likelihood that a crime actually gets reported. We're also separating chronic high-crime areas — places where crime has been consistently high and is well understood — from emerging high-volatility areas where patterns are actively shifting. The goal is to make sure resources don't just get locked into historical patterns. We'll also build in checks against over-concentration, like flagging neighborhoods where reported crime looks suspiciously low given what we'd expect, and setting minimum coverage thresholds so no district gets completely ignored."
