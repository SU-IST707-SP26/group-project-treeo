Title
A nice short title for your project, helping me to understand roughly what it is you are trying to do.

Team
We are team Treeo. Our group consists of Madelyn Forster (mgforste), Ashley Rauch (ashrauch4) and Brealin Redecker (brealinredecker). The POC person will be ____.


Introduction
Our project will be about prediciting crime and the volatility of the crime. 
We are going to use our crime data to uncover patterns, predict hotspots, and improve public safety by analyzing historical incident data, location, and time. 

Our approach uses old methods of crime prediction such as hotspot analysis, geospatial mapping, and predictive policing to proactively deploy resources but we will add to this by 
identifying trends within a specific area and changes in behavior over time. Looking at if crime tendencies are the same now as they were in 2020. This is important when teaching
police officers how to go about the crimes. We think this will be successful because our dataset gives us all the possible variables, such as time and location, to implement our models. 

Who should care about this? In 2023, 22,830 people were killed via homocide. There are more on top of this due to those that get injured due to aggrevated crimes. 
This trend has improved over time and in 2025, crimes are decreasing per capita. But they are still happening and, unfortunately, are inevitable. To prepare for such events, cities have
to equip their policing departments with the proper information to handle the crimes more efficiently. Our analysis is designed to inform the cities the areas that are more prone to 
crimes to put a proper amount of officers and equipment there. This will hopefully better handle the crimes and save more lives along the way. 


Literature Review

How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Here, you will review methods that have been attempted (use Google Scholar to find out), or cite literature to provide evidence that your method is novel. You should include citations to reviewed material. Use github's markdown syntax for footnotes1.

Also use this section to establish stakeholder needs. That is, for stakeholders that have specific but perhaps non-obvious needs (e.g., a city traffic planner will need to know about temporal variation in pedestrian traffic and the density of office buildings in order to determine the best placement of traffic signals). You should list each of your stakeholders here, explain why they are stakeholders, and the clarify needs. Recall from our lecture that I do not expect you to do your own stakeholder interviews, but I do expect you to do a little research online.

Data and Methods
This section will introduce your data and specify your modeling approach.

Data
You will include a link to your data, along with summary information (e.g., how many columns, rows, and the types of features). Also include some discussion about the data's provenance - how do you know the data is reliable? Does it have meta data, and if not, what else do you know about it? If you anticipate needing more than one dataset, please indicate each dataset you anticipate needing and provide evidence that those datasets are available.

Methods
Describe your modeling approach. What sorts of transformations / preprocessing are going to be necessary? What sorts of modeling techniques will you apply? How are you going to evaluate your models (note that your evaluation should be consistent with stakeholder needs)?

Project Plan
Along with this project proposal, you will commit an initial version of the project management documents. However, I would also like you to provide a rough timeline here for the project in the following form, broken out into two week periods.

Period	Activity	Milestone
9/10 - 9/23	Stakeholder analysis
EDA
Initial exploration with LSTM networks on toy data	Completed stakeholder analysis and data exploration. Additional datasets identified as necessary.
9/24 - 10/8	Preprocessing and modeling refinements. Continuing exploration of LSTM and other temporal ML techniques	Initial pass with cleaned data. Candidate approaches for modeling finalized.
etc.

Risks
This section will describe potential risks to the project. This should include both potential pitfalls and roadblocks, as well as any approaches to mitigation. What will you do if some aspect of your plan fails?

Grading
Does your proposal include all of the above mentioned sections? [1 point]
Have you clearly identifed your stakeholders and their needs [1 point]
Have you answered the 5 Heilmeier questions mentioned effectively [1 points]
Are your initial project management documents in place and do they follow the guidelines [1 point]
Is you proposal plan feasible, and do you have sufficient detail to give me confidence that you will succeed? [1 point]
