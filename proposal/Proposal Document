## Enhancing Public Safety: A Comprehensive Analysis of Geospatial Shifts in Los Angeles and Prediction of Crime Volatility

### Team
Our team, Treeo, consists of three members:
- Ashley Rauch will act as the POC for the group - ashrauch4
- Madeyln Forster - mgforste
- Brealin Redecker (brealinredecker)

### Introduction
Our crime reporting dataset reflects all incidents of crime in the City of Los Angeles dating back to 2020, collected by The Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD). Ensuring the safety of the public is a fundamental responsibility of the government. Crime, of all levels, can lead to loss of life, physical injury, and significant economic and social impacts on individuals and communities. While a certain level of crime may be considered inevitable, we aim to uncover structural shifts in crime patterns and build a tool that predicts crime volatility and potential "hotspots". The tool will enable the development of evidence-based strategies in terms of resource allocation, prevention, and intervention to improve public safety. 

Many crime prediction models explore the association between a single factor, typically demographic data, and crimes. With the rise of AI and machine learning, predicting crime volatility is beginning to evolve from static hotspot mapping into predictive policing. Our approach will build on this by mapping dynamic systems and identifying when crime profiles change. This approach will allow stakeholders to distinguish between chronic crime areas and emerging high-volatility areas that may need more attention as a way to proactively deploy resources. Our dataset contains all the variables needed to successfully implement the approach and our models.

In Los Angeles, there was a peak in most crime categories during the pandemic. Since then, there has been an overall downward trend across many categories. However, crimes will always occur and the rates by neighborhoods are constantly changing. Success in this project will provide the LAPD and city administratives with a dyanmic resource allocation tool. It will ensure resources are present in emerging high-volatility zones rather than more stable ones as well as aid in future city infrastructure planning. More lives will be protected and the city will be a safer place to live.

### Literature Review
Would you guys be able to do this? I kept the instructions in it. 
How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Here, you will review methods that have been attempted (use Google Scholar to find out), or cite literature to provide evidence that your method is novel. You should include citations to reviewed material. Use github's markdown syntax for footnotes1.

Also use this section to establish stakeholder needs. That is, for stakeholders that have specific but perhaps non-obvious needs (e.g., a city traffic planner will need to know about temporal variation in pedestrian traffic and the density of office buildings in order to determine the best placement of traffic signals). You should list each of your stakeholders here, explain why they are stakeholders, and the clarify needs. Recall from our lecture that I do not expect you to do your own stakeholder interviews, but I do expect you to do a little research online.

Data and Methods
Our data is from 'data.gov' and is a crime data set that gives crime information from 2020-present given by the Los Angeles Police Department. With this data, we plan to run some 
easy-to-understand models in order to help LAPD. We will use grid-based clustering by dividing LA into geographic cells and predicting crime density in each area. Once we have the 
'hotspot areas', we will add the time variable to this and use change point detection to pinpoint exact months/quarters when crime patterns changed significantly. Then, once we know
the answers (outputs) to our data, we will run a random forest to predict if an area will have high crime given time, location, day of week. If time permits, we also want to run a 
K-Means Clustering model to analyze trends over time and see how the crime clusters have changed from 2020 to 2025.

Data
Our data is from 'data.gov' and is Crime data from 2020-Present in Los Angeles. Here is a link to where to download our data, 'https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/crime-data-from-2020-to-present'. 
Our data has 28 columns, 1,004,991 rows with 13 string columns, 7 integer columns, and 8 float columns. 

The data is reliable because it is from a '.gov' website which means everything they post has to be accurate. According to the Freedom of Information Act, they are legally obligated 
to disclose information—including crime data and records of misconduct—under public records laws.

Our data does have meta data. It is in a json format within the link of the data. Some takeaways from the meta data, published by the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD), it is
publically available data, and it was last updated on January 2, 2026.


Methods
This needs to be done. 
Describe your modeling approach. What sorts of transformations / preprocessing are going to be necessary? What sorts of modeling techniques will you apply? How are you going to evaluate your models (note that your evaluation should be consistent with stakeholder needs)?

Project Plan
2/2-2/16: EDA, data cleaning, initial summary graphs/descriptions
2/16-3/2: Initial analysis, first model and its effectiveness
3/2-3/16: Build off of the first model, explore its errors and areas for improvement. Begin to work on second model while improving on the first model.
3/16-3/30: Finish second model and have the first model established and ready to go.
3/30-4/13: Identify takeaways from our models and add anything we might think is necessary.
4/13-4/27: Finishing touches/making the project easily understandable.


Risks
This needs to be completed. 

This section will describe potential risks to the project. This should include both potential pitfalls and roadblocks, as well as any approaches to mitigation. What will you do if some aspect of your plan fails?

Grading
