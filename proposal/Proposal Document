Title
A nice short title for your project, helping me to understand roughly what it is you are trying to do.

Team
We are team Treeo. Our group consists of Madelyn Forster (mgforste), Ashley Rauch (suID) and Brealin Redecker (suID). The POC person will be ____.


Introduction
This section will introduce your project. It will briefly answer the following questions from Heilmeier's catechism.

What are you trying to do? Articulate your objectives using absolutely no jargon.
What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful? (be brief here, you can expand more later!)
Who cares? If you are successful, what difference will it make?


Literature Review
This section will answer the second question from Heilmeier's catechism:

How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Here, you will review methods that have been attempted (use Google Scholar to find out), or cite literature to provide evidence that your method is novel. You should include citations to reviewed material. Use github's markdown syntax for footnotes1.

Also use this section to establish stakeholder needs. That is, for stakeholders that have specific but perhaps non-obvious needs (e.g., a city traffic planner will need to know about temporal variation in pedestrian traffic and the density of office buildings in order to determine the best placement of traffic signals). You should list each of your stakeholders here, explain why they are stakeholders, and the clarify needs. Recall from our lecture that I do not expect you to do your own stakeholder interviews, but I do expect you to do a little research online.

Data and Methods
This section will introduce your data and specify your modeling approach.

Data
You will include a link to your data, along with summary information (e.g., how many columns, rows, and the types of features). Also include some discussion about the data's provenance - how do you know the data is reliable? Does it have meta data, and if not, what else do you know about it? If you anticipate needing more than one dataset, please indicate each dataset you anticipate needing and provide evidence that those datasets are available.

Methods
Describe your modeling approach. What sorts of transformations / preprocessing are going to be necessary? What sorts of modeling techniques will you apply? How are you going to evaluate your models (note that your evaluation should be consistent with stakeholder needs)?

Project Plan
Along with this project proposal, you will commit an initial version of the project management documents. However, I would also like you to provide a rough timeline here for the project in the following form, broken out into two week periods.

Period	Activity	Milestone
9/10 - 9/23	Stakeholder analysis
EDA
Initial exploration with LSTM networks on toy data	Completed stakeholder analysis and data exploration. Additional datasets identified as necessary.
9/24 - 10/8	Preprocessing and modeling refinements. Continuing exploration of LSTM and other temporal ML techniques	Initial pass with cleaned data. Candidate approaches for modeling finalized.
etc.

Risks
This section will describe potential risks to the project. This should include both potential pitfalls and roadblocks, as well as any approaches to mitigation. What will you do if some aspect of your plan fails?

Grading
Does your proposal include all of the above mentioned sections? [1 point]
Have you clearly identifed your stakeholders and their needs [1 point]
Have you answered the 5 Heilmeier questions mentioned effectively [1 points]
Are your initial project management documents in place and do they follow the guidelines [1 point]
Is you proposal plan feasible, and do you have sufficient detail to give me confidence that you will succeed? [1 point]
