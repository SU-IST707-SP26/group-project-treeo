## Current Vision

### Project: Enhancing Public Safety - A Comprehensive Analysis of Geospatial Shifts in Los Angeles and Prediction of Crime Volatility

**Primary Stakeholder:** Government authorities who need to make informed decisions that maximize public safety, specifically the LA Police Department

**Secondary Stakeholders:** 
- City residents (understanding crime and deployment patterns)
- City planning (infrastructure decisions)

**Problem Statement:** Los Angeles government authorities, specifically the police department, currently lack predictive information about crime volatility and hotspots throughout the city. Predictive policing approaches are too simple as they are subject to near-repeat victimization, lack transparency, and include biases which make it difficult for departments to make informed decisions about resource allocation that best protects its citizens. 

**Solution:** We will build a machine learning model that predicts crime counts and intensity based on geographic units in LA. We will incorporate temporal patterns and other factors which will allow stakeholders to distinguish between chronic crime areas and emerging high-volatility areas that may need more attention as a way to proactively deploy resources.
